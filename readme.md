# Real Simple Analytics WordPress Plugin

The Real Simple Analytics WordPress Plugin provides a way to insert your analytics tracking scripts in the header 
of your WordPress site without any additional plugin bloat.

This plugin is for people who _only_ need their analytics code added to the WordPress site and do not care about 
having graphics, charts and reports available within WordPress.

## How to Install

Download the most recent version of the plugin from the [plugin homepage](https://code.jonathanbriehl.com) or 
from this repository.

In your WordPress administration panel, go to `Plugins`, select `Add New` then `Upload Plugin` to upload the 
zip file. After the upload is complete, click `Activate`.

## How to Use

The goal of Real Simple Analytics is to keep it easy. All you need is your analytics script 
(such as Google Analytics).

From the WordPress administration panel, go to `Settings > Real Simple Analytics`. Paste your analytics script into 
the text box and click `Save`.

Once saved, the script will be included in the `<head>` when your site loads.
